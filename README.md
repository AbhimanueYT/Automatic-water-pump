# Smart Automatic Water Pump Controller for Basement Drainage  

**Description:**  
This project showcases an intelligent water pump controller designed for efficient basement rainwater drainage. Using an Arduino Nano and an ultrasonic sensor, the system automates water level monitoring and pump control, while also incorporating manual override and safety features.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Automatic Water Level Control:** The ultrasonic sensor measures water depth, and the Arduino Nano automatically activates the pump when water exceeds a threshold, turning it off once the water is drained below the set level.  
2. **Manual Override:** A manual switch allows users to control the pump directly when needed, offering flexibility and control.  
3. **Pump Performance Monitoring:** The system detects if the pump is running but failing to drain water efficiently. If such a scenario occurs, a buzzer alert is triggered, and the motor is automatically stopped to prevent energy waste and motor damage.  
4. **Energy Efficiency and Safety:** Prevents unnecessary pump operation, conserving energy and extending pump life while safeguarding against potential flooding.  

This system combines automation, user control, and fault detection, making it a reliable solution for managing rainwater in residential or commercial basements. It is an excellent example of integrating IoT, automation, and smart safety features for real-world problem-solving.
